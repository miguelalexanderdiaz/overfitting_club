*I wrangle messy, real‑world data into products your users actually love—from classical ML to agentic systems—delivered with calm, drama‑free MLOps.*

### Current Interests

- **Deep Learning on the Edge:** Quantization, pruning, distillation, and other tiny sorcery to run big brains on small chips (Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, etc.).

- **Tiny agents on device:** Local LLMs with manners: tool calling, confident with local data, and calling the cloud only when it truly matters.

*Why? Because GPUs don’t grow on trees (tragic), so we build clever, resource savvy systems that do more with less.*
